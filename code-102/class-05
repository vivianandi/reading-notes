# Read: 05 - Design web pages with CSS

**CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)** - a language for specifying how documents are presented to users — how they are styled, laid out, etc.
- CSS is a rule-based language — you define the rules by specifying groups of styles that should be applied to particular elements or groups of elements on your web page

## Q&A
**1. What is the purpose of CSS?**
The purpose of CSS is to separate the structure of a web page (HTML) from its presentation, allowing developers to control the layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects of a website

**2. What are the three ways to insert CSS into your project?**
- **Inline CSS:** You can apply styles directly within the HTML tags using the style attribute. For example:
`html <p style="color: red;">This is a red paragraph.</p>`

- **Internal/Embedded CSS:** You can include CSS within the HTML document using the <style> element in the <head> section. For example:
`html <head> <style> p { color: blue; } </style> </head> <body> <p>This is a blue paragraph.</p> </body>`

- **External CSS:** You can create a separate CSS file and link it to your HTML document using the <link> element in the <head> section. For example:
`html <head> <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css"> </head>`

**3. Write an example of a CSS rule that would give all <p> elements red text.**
`p {
   color: red;
}`
