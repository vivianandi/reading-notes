# Structure Web Pages with HTML

A **wireframe** is a practice used by UX designers which allows them to define and plan the information hierarchy of their design for a website, app, or product.

- Allows us to see how a user interacts with your interface, through the positioning of buttons and menus on the diagrams

## Steps to Make a Wireframe
**1. Do research** 
- Understanding who your audience is by way of user research
- Detailing requirements
- Creating user personas and defining use cases 
- Further competitor and industry research (review similar product lines, even outside domain, look at prevailing UX trends and best practises)

**2.  Make research cheat sheet for reference**

**3. Have user flow mapped out**

**4. Draft, don’t draw. Sketch, don’t illustrate**
- Remember: you’re outlining and representing features and formats, not illustrating in mighty fine detail
- Some questions to consider: 
  - How can you organise the content to support your users’ goals?
  - Which information should be most prominent? Where should your main message go? What should the user see first when arriving at the page?
  - What will the user expect to see on certain areas of the page?
  - Which buttons or touch points does the user need to complete the desired actions?

**5. Add some detail and get testing**

**6. Start turning your wireframes into prototypes**

# HTML BASICS
**HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content

In general, an **HTML element** consists of a start tag, element content , and an end tag
![](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics/grumpy-cat-small.png)
- The **start tag**/**opening tag**, displayed as two angle brackets with the **tagname** in the middle (`<h1>`, `<div>`, `<p>`) marks the start of an HTML element
- The **end tag**/**closing tag**, displayed as two angle brackets with a slash `/` and tagname in the middle (`</h1>`, `</div>`, `</p>`) marks the end of an HTML element
- Anything in between the start and end tags of an HTML element is the **content of the element**
    - Content is typically text or other HTML elements
    - Adding HTML elements to the content of other HTML elements is called **nesting**

**Attributes** that set a value always have:
- A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute, if the element already has one or more attributes)
- The attribute name followed by an equal sign
- The attribute value wrapped by opening and closing quotation marks

**Void Elements** - add an image
Add image in body, include the correct path
`<img src="img/img.jpeg" alt="A photo of a rainbow."/>`
- In the alt attribute, you specify descriptive text for users who cannot see the image

HTML **elements** are the building blocks of HTML

- `div` “division” element, often referred to as a container element
- `p` “paragraph” element
- `h1`, and `h2` through `h6`, “header” elements,
- `ul` “unordered list” element
- `ol` “ordered list” element
- `li` “list item” element
- `<a>` "a" being the short form for "anchor" -> this is a link

**What is it called when you give an element extra information?**
Attribute??

**What is a semantic element?**
