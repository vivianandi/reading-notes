## Javascript
JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight interpreted (or just-in-time compiled) programming language with first-class functions

**Variables** are Containers for storing data
- Declared automatically or using var, let, or const
- Always declare before use for good practice
- **const** for unchanging values and types (arrays and objects)
- **let** when const can't be used
- **var** only for older browser support

**JavaScript Identifiers**
- Unique names for variables
- Case-sensitive, starts with a letter
- Can contain letters, digits, _, and $
- Avoid reserved words
- Good practice: Use clear, descriptive, specific names

**The Assignment Operator**
- = is an assignment, not "equal to"
- Use == for equality comparison

**JavaScript Data Types**
- Numbers
  - Written without quotes
- Strings
   - Inside double or single quote

**Declaring JavaScript Variables**
- Use var or let for declaration
  - var variables can be re-declared
  - let and const cannot be re-declared
- Declare all variables at the beginning of a script
- `let variable = value;` for one-line declaration
- You can eclare multiple variables in one statement
  - Use let and separate with commas
  - `let person = "John Doe", carName = "Volvo", price = 200;`
  - A declaration can span multiple lines as well

**Value = undefined**
- Variables without values are undefined
- Common for calculations or user inputs

**JavaScript Arithmetic**
- Can do arithmetic with JavaScript variables, using operators like `=` and `+`
- Can concatenate strings with `+`
- If you put a number in quotes, the rest of the numbers will be treated as strings, and concatenated
