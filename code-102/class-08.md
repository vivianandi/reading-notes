# Read: 08 - Operators and Loops

## Expressions and Operators
An **expression** is a valid unit of code that resolves to a value
- There are two types of expressions: 
  - Those that have side effects (such as assigning values) 
  - Those that purely evaluate

An **assignment operator** assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand

A **comparison operator** compares its operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true
- The operands can be numerical, string, logical, or object values

**Strict Equality and Inequality**
- `=== (strict equal)` and `!== (strict not equal)` operators perform comparisons without type conversion
- These operators check equality without converting operands to compatible types

## Loops
**Loops** offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly
- Think of a loop as a computerized version of the game where you tell someone to take X steps in one direction, then Y steps in another

**`for` statement**
A **for loop** repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false
- **Example**
`for (initialization; condition; afterthought)`
  `statement`
- When a for loop executes, the following occurs:
  1. Initialization
      - The initializing expression is executed
      - It typically initializes loop counters or declares variables
  2. Condition Evaluation
      - The condition expression is evaluated
      - If true, the loop statements execute; otherwise, the loop terminates
      - If the condition is omitted, it is assumed to be true
  3. Statement Execution
  4. Update Expression
  5. Control Return


**`while` statement**
A **while statement** executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true
- **Example**
`while (condition)`
  `statement`

- If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the statement following the loop

## Q&A
**1. What is an `expression` in JavaScript?**
A valid unit of code that resolves to a value

**2. Why would we use a loop in our code?**
**Loops** offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly

**3. When does a `for` loop stop executing?**
A for loop stops executing when the condition specified in the loop header becomes false

**4. How many times will a `while` loop execute?**
A while loop will execute as long as the specified condition in the loop header is true
