**Whatâ€™s the relationship between REST and CRUD?** 
- CRUD operations align with HTTP methods used in RESTful APIs
- RESTful APIs implement CRUD functionalities for resource manipulation
- REST principles ensure scalable and maintainable API design

**If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?**
1. Define Resources: Identify resources and assign unique URIs

2. Choose HTTP Methods: Assign HTTP methods for CRUD operations

3. Design Endpoints: Define URL patterns for resources and operations

4. Implement Controllers/Handlers: Develop logic for processing requests

5. Test and Document: Test endpoints and create documentation
