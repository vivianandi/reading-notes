The background color is like the color you choose for the paper behind the drawings. It's the color that surrounds everything on the webpage.

**font-size:** It's like changing the text size. You can make it bigger or smaller, depending on how you want it to stand out.
**font-weight:** This is about making text bold or keeping it normal. Bold text can grab attention and emphasize important points.
**font-style:** This is like italicizing text. It adds a bit of flair or emphasis to make certain words or phrases stand out.
