# HTML Lists, Control Flow with JS, and the CSS Box Model

## [Learn HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) 
**1. When should you use an `unordered list` in your HTML document?**
Use an unordered list `(<ul>)` when you want to represent a list of items that doesn't have a specific order or sequence

**2. How do you change the `bullet style` of unordered list items?**
Using `list-style-type` property in CSS

**3. When should you use an `ordered list` vs an `unordered list` in your HTML document?**
Use an ordered list `(<ol>)` when the items in your list have a specific order or sequence. Unordered lists, on the other hand, are suitable when the order of items is not significant.

**4. Describe two ways you can change the numbers on `list items` provided by an `ordered list`?**
CSS and HTML attributes

## [Learn CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS)
**1. Describe the CSS properties of `margin` and `padding` as characters in a story. What is their role in a story titled: “The Box Model”?**
Margie Margin and Paddy Padding, characters in "The Box Model" story, played crucial roles in maintaining order and comfort. Margie, the reserved boundary, defined space around elements, while Paddy, the warm cushion, added a cozy touch. Together, they created a harmonious balance in the village of HTML Hollow.

**2. List and describe the four parts of an HTML elements box as referred to by the `box model`.**
**Content:** Represents the innermost area of the box, containing the actual content such as text, images, or other media.
**Padding:** Surrounds the content and provides space between the content and the border. It acts like a cushion, ensuring that the content doesn't touch the box's edges.
**Border:** Forms the outer boundary of the box, encapsulating both the content and padding. It defines the visible edges of the element, separating it from other elements in the layout.
**Margin:** Positioned outside the border, the margin creates space between the element and its surrounding elements. It acts as a buffer, controlling the spacing between elements in the overall layout.

## [Learn Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript)
**1. What data types can you store inside of an Array?**
Various data types which includes numbers, strings, booleans, objects, arrays, functions, undefined, null

**2. Is the people array a valid JavaScript array? If so, how can I access the values stored? If not, why?**
Yes

**3. List five shorthand operators for assignment in javascript and describe what they do.**
**+= (Addition Assignment):** It adds the value on the right to the current value of the variable on the left and assigns the result back to the variable.
**-= (Subtraction Assignment):** It subtracts the value on the right from the current value of the variable on the left and assigns the result back to the variable.
***= (Multiplication Assignment):** It multiplies the current value of the variable on the left by the value on the right and assigns the result back to the variable.
**/= (Division Assignment):** It divides the current value of the variable on the left by the value on the right and assigns the result back to the variable.
**%= (Modulus Assignment):** It performs the modulus operation on the current value of the variable on the left with the value on the right and assigns the remainder back to the variable.

**4. Read the code below and evaluate the last expression and explain what the result would be and why.**

 let a = 10;
 let b = 'dog';
 let c = false;

 // evaluate this
 (a + c) + b;

It is the string '10dog'. The number 10 is converted to its string representation and concatenated with the string 'dog'.

**5. Describe a real world example of when a conditional statement should be used in a JavaScript program.**
An example is making an age restricted app for example an alcohol company - you can use conditional statements to provide access or not depending on legal drinking age in the country.

**6. Give an example of when a Loop is useful in JavaScript.**
A loop is useful when you need to iterate over a collection of items or perform a repetitive task.
