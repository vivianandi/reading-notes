CSS transforms enable developers to manipulate the position, size, and rotation of HTML elements in a 2D or 3D space
- Transforms can be applied to enhance the visual presentation and interactivity of elements on a webpage

## [CSS Transitions & Animations](https://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/transitions-animations/)
**What does a CSS transition allow the developer to do to an element?**
A CSS transition allows developers to smoothly animate changes in CSS properties over a specified duration -> this provides a more polished and visually appealing user experience by smoothly transitioning between states when triggered by events like hover or click

**How does a CSS animation differ from a CSS transition?**
Difference Between CSS Animation and Transition:
- CSS Transition:
  - Occurs when there is a change in an element's state (e.g., color, size)
  - Requires a starting state and an ending state
  - Typically triggered by user interactions, like hover or click
  - Has a defined duration and timing function

- CSS Animation:
  - Offers more complex and continuous animations
  - Uses keyframes to define a sequence of styles at different points in time
  -  Can loop infinitely or play a set number of times
  - Offers greater control over intricate animations compared to transitions
