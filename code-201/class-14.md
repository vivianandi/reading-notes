## [CSS Transitions & Animations](https://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/transitions-animations/)
**What does a CSS transition allow the developer to do to an element?**
A CSS transition allows developers to smoothly animate changes in CSS properties over a specified duration -> this provides a more polished and visually appealing user experience by smoothly transitioning between states when triggered by events like hover or click

**How does a CSS animation differ from a CSS transition?**
Difference Between CSS Animation and Transition:
- CSS Transition:
  - Occurs when there is a change in an element's state (e.g., color, size)
  - Requires a starting state and an ending state
  - Typically triggered by user interactions, like hover or click
  - Has a defined duration and timing function

- CSS Animation:
  - Offers more complex and continuous animations
  - Uses keyframes to define a sequence of styles at different points in time
  -  Can loop infinitely or play a set number of times
  - Offers greater control over intricate animations compared to transitions

# Psychological Safety

## Notes
## Key Points
- Data-Driven Inquiry: Project Aristotle commenced in 2012, analyzing decades of studies and Google's internal data to discern patterns in team composition. Contrary to expectations, the researchers struggled to identify specific traits or backgrounds that consistently contributed to team success.

- Group Norms as Key Factors: Researchers shifted focus to 'group norms,' uncovering their profound impact on team effectiveness. The study emphasized the importance of norms governing conversational turn-taking and average social sensitivity.

- Equality in Turn-Taking and Social Sensitivity: Successful teams exhibited equal participation in discussions ('equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking') and high 'average social sensitivity.' These norms, collectively termed psychological safety, became critical in determining a team's success.

- Team A vs. Team B Scenario: Illustrates that, despite Team A's efficiency, Team B's inclusivity and emotional awareness contribute to greater collective intelligence.

- Sakaguchi's Experience: Matt Sakaguchi's application of Project Aristotle's findings within his team exemplifies how surveying team norms, fostering psychological safety, and sharing personal stories can lead to enhanced team dynamics.

## Context
- Data-Driven Silicon Valley Culture: Project Aristotle reveals that, despite Silicon Valley's emphasis on data-driven approaches, the fundamental principles of effective teamwork revolve around emotional connections, empathy, and psychological safety.

- Relevance Beyond Google: The insights gained from Project Aristotle challenge conventional notions and offer a valuable framework for team optimization in various workplaces.

## Conclusion
- Project Aristotle emphasizes that successful teams are not solely about individual brilliance but depend on interpersonal dynamics, emotional connections, and a culture of psychological safety. The findings have implications for understanding, cultivating, and optimizing team collaboration beyond the confines of Google.


## Questions
**What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams?**
- Equality in Conversational Turn-Taking: Successful teams ensure that every member has an opportunity to contribute to discussions, fostering a sense of inclusivity and equal participation.

- Average Social Sensitivity: High levels of social sensitivity among team members, demonstrated through empathy and understanding of nonverbal cues, contribute to a psychologically safe environment.

- Shared Belief in Psychological Safety: Teams actively cultivate a shared belief that the team is a safe space for interpersonal risk-taking, creating an environment where members feel confident in expressing themselves without fear of judgment or reprisal.

**Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety.**
1. During my initial months at a law firm in Washington, D.C., I encountered a team within the finance department that grappled with poor psychological safety. The finance manager's distant and non-collaborative approach, coupled with a supervisor who employed intimidation tactics, resulted in an environment where team members were reluctant to express concerns or share ideas openly. This stifling atmosphere hindered creativity and innovation, fostering a culture of conformity.

The impact on productivity was palpable, with work processes slowing down considerably. Compounding the issue, team members began holding secret meetings to discuss their feelings and share their experiences, ultimately leading to a collective decision to bring these concerns to HR. This clandestine communication underscored the lack of trust and openness within the team, further impeding our ability to address challenges collaboratively and contribute to a more inclusive and engaging workplace culture.

2. In a recent role, I joined a team responsible for migrating financial systems at the Department of Justice. Unlike a previous experience at a law firm where communication barriers stifled productivity, this team thrived on open dialogue and psychological safety.

Under the guidance of our supportive manager, we embraced a collaborative approach. Our manager encouraged open communication, making it clear that every team member's input was valued. This environment fostered seamless teamwork, with a focus on collective success rather than individual efforts.

Our proactive issue tracking and follow-up processes, supported by a culture of mutual support, ensured efficient problem resolution. The shared sense of purpose and trust within the team significantly boosted overall productivity and job satisfaction. This experience underscored the transformative power of psychological safety in fostering a cohesive and successful work environment.
**What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members?**
Teams operating with a high degree of psychological safety can have several positive impacts:
- Increased Innovation and Creativity: A safe environment encourages team members to share diverse perspectives and ideas, fostering innovation and creative problem-solving.
- Enhanced Collaboration: Psychological safety promotes open communication, leading to better collaboration and stronger interpersonal relationships among team members.
- Higher Employee Satisfaction: Teams with psychological safety contribute to a positive work culture, leading to increased job satisfaction and overall well-being of team members.
- Improved Performance: Members are more likely to take risks and contribute their best when they feel psychologically safe, ultimately enhancing the team's overall performance.
