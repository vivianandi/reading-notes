# Debugging

## What Went Wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript.
**1. Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.**
- Syntax errors: These are spelling errors in your code that actually cause the program not to run at all, or stop working part way through
- Logic errors: These are errors where the syntax is actually correct but the code is not what you intended it to be, meaning that program runs successfully but gives incorrect results

**2. List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.**
Not defining a variable - fixed when the code has nothing to run through, syntax errors that you might just miss - the errors that pop up will help with spotting the error

**3. How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?**
Knowing different error types will allow for better problem solving and troubleshooting, it will allow me to work with others and help them spot errors/helping with testing

## The JavaScript Debugger.
**1.How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?**
- The devtools live inside your browser in a subwindow 
- How do you pull it up? 
Keyboard - macOS: ⌘ + ⌥ + I
- This tool shows what the HTML on your page looks like at runtime, as well as what CSS is applied to each element on the page

**2. Define what a breakpoint is.**
A breakpoint is a designated point in your code where the debugger will pause its execution

**3. What is the call stack?**
The call stack is a fundamental concept in programming and debugging. It represents the sequence of function calls that are currently being executed. Each time a function is called, a new entry is added to the top of the call stack, and when a function completes, its entry is removed. The call stack helps the debugger keep track of the context of execution.
