## [Learn CSS - Flexbox](https://web.dev/learn/css/flexbox/)

**1. Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.**
It is a layout that excels at taking a bunch of items which have different sizes, and returning the best layout for those items -> it provides flexible boundaries to hint how the content could display.

**2. Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.**
The **main axis** is the one set by your flex-direction property
- If that is row your main axis is along the row, if it is column your main axis is along the column
The **cross axis** runs in the other direction to the main axis
- If flex-direction is row the cross axis runs along the column

**3. How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?**
The row-reverse and column-reverse values are an example of how flexbox negatively impact accessibility
- The reordering only happens for the visual order, not the logical order, which is the order that a screen reader will read out the content, and anyone navigating using the keyboard will follow
