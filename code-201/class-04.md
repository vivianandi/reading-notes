## [CSS Layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout)
**1. What is meant by “normal flow”?**
"Normal flow" refers to the default layout behavior of HTML elements, where elements are displayed one after another in the order they appear in the HTML document.

**2. What are a few differences between `block-level` and `inline` elements?**
**Block-level elements:** Start on a new line, take up the full width available, and create a "block" of content. Examples include `<div>, <p>, <h1> to <h6>`.
**Inline elements:** Do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary. They flow within the content. Examples include `<span>, <strong>, <a>`.

**3. ___ positioning is the default for every html element.**
Static

**4. Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.**
Precise placement, layering

**5. What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?**
**Absolute Positioning:** Positions an element relative to its nearest positioned (not static) ancestor or to the initial containing block if no positioned ancestor is found.
**Fixed Positioning:** Positions an element relative to the browser window. It remains fixed even when the page is scrolled.

## [Learn JS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript)
**1. Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.**
**Function Declaration:** A function declaration is a way to define a function in JavaScript. It consists of the function keyword, followed by the function name, a list of parameters enclosed in parentheses, and the function body enclosed in curly braces. It defines the function but does not execute it immediately.
**Function Invocation (or Call):** Function invocation, also known as calling or executing a function, is the act of actually using the defined function by its name followed by parentheses. It triggers the execution of the function code.

**2. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?**
**Parameter:** A parameter is a variable listed in the function declaration. It acts as a placeholder for the values that the function will receive when it is invoked. Parameters are used within the function body.
**Argument:** An argument is the actual value or expression passed to a function when it is invoked. Arguments are the values that replace the parameters in the function call.
