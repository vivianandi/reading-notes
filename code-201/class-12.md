# Chart.js, Canvas
## [JavaScript Canvas](https://www.javascripttutorial.net/web-apis/javascript-canvas/)
**What does the `<canvas>` allow a developer to acheive?**
`<canvas>` allows developers to draw graphics, create animations, and manipulate images directly in the browser using JavaScript. It provides a drawing surface where dynamic rendering can occur.

**What is the importance of the closing `</canvas>` tag?**
It defines the end of the canvas element and ensures proper nesting within the HTML structure. It is correct HTML syntax and is necessary for the browser to interpret and render the content accurately.

**Explain what the `getContext()` method does.**
The getContext() method, applied to a `<canvas>` element, retrieves the rendering context â€” an object that provides methods and properties for drawing on the canvas.
