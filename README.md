## Growth Mindset
Someone has a **growth mindset** when they are *life long learners*. There is a focus on setting goals that may be difficult, allowing one self to make mistakes, push through growing pains and learn new things.

> I haven't failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work.
- Thomas Edison

### How to keep myself in a growth mindset:
- Do not be afraid to ask questions
- Set goals for myself and do not compare my progress to anyone else's
- Take a break when I struggle
